collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-01-01-large-deviations-2
excerpt: 'This paper studies large deviations of p-norms of stationary regularly varying time series. It introduces α-clusters, where α is the tail-index of the series, and proposes consistent disjoint blocks estimators of α-cluster features. This new methodology proves to be robust to handle time dependencies.'
