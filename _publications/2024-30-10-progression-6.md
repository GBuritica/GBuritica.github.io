excerpt: 'Leveraging the theory of tail dependence, this article presents a method for regression extrapolation to predict beyond the observed data range. To achieve this, we derive suitable restrictions on the regression function at the boundary of the training sample. These conditions holds for a wide range of models including non-parametric regression functions with additive noise. Moreover, we establish approximation error guarantees quantifying how far we can extrapolate with a function veryfing these boundary constrains. This results justify our learning strategy, which focuses on learning the constraints and applying them to produce reliable extrapolation predictions. '
