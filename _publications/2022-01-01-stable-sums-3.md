title: "Stable sums to infer high return levels of  multivariate rainfall time series"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-01-01-stable-sums-3
excerpt: 'This paper presents the stable sums method to infer high return levels of multivariate heavy-tailed time series. This new method is justified by the large deviations of powers of α-sums, where α is the tail-index of the series. Its main advantage is that is implementation coincides for dependent and independent time series.'
