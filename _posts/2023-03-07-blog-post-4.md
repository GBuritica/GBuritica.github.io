'Beautiful world, where are you' by Sally Rooney.


The story narrates the young adult life of four characters: two girl friends and the two men they see. Alice, a novelist, meets Felix after moving to a small Irish town to recover from a depression episode. In Dublin, her friend Eileen upholds a long-lasting lover's relationship with Simon, whom she has known since childhood. The four grow together and participate in each other lives in both trivial and complex ways. Overall, the novel develops how each character balances personal relationships on a one-to-one scale with, for example, friends and family, and their social responsibilities with work and social gatherings. In this way, the interconnection between the individual and the social aspects of relationships is beautifully highlighted.
