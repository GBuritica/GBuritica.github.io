'Normal people' by Sally Rooney.

The book is the story of a teenager's love lasting until early adulthood. Marianne is a young girl living in an uncomfortable relationship with her world. She meets Connel, the housekeeper's son, and one of her classmates from school. The secret encounter ties them together in an accomplice friendship that will shape most of their early life decisions. Their relationship follows a troublesome attachment and let-go dynamic; everything in between is joyful and connecting moments. Their attraction and trust constantly drag them together, even after long periods of separation. In the end, they are both unable to commit, partly because they are afraid but also because they feel undeserving of love. Marianne and Connel are normal people.
