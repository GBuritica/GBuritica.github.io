I'm a lecturer in statistics at MIA Paris-Saclay, AgroParisTech. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Université de Genève](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/fr/recherche/corps-professoral/chercheurs/gloria-buritica-borda/) working with Prof. [Sebastian Engelke](http://www.sengelke.com). I completed my Ph.D. at the LPSM laboratory in Sorbonne Université under the supervision of Prof. [Philippe Naveau](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/Phocea/Pisp/visu.php?id=176&uid=naveau) and Prof. [Olivier Wintenberger](http://wintenberger.fr).

## My research

I specialize in extreme value theory, heavy-tailed time series, and machine learning. My work often involves risk assessment with a primary focus on climate science applications.


Beyond my research, I love reading and a fresh just-grind cup of Colombian coffee. I specially enjoy gathering with friends and family around flavorful food and pursuing bucolic landscapes. 

## Ongoing projects

Currently learning about out-of-domain generalization problems in machine learning.

### Ph.D. Thesis 

Here you can find the [*slides*](/files/Oral_slides-10.pdf) and the final [*manuscript*](/files/these_archivage_3701601.pdf) of my Ph.D. thesis entitled "Assessing the time dependence of multivariate extremes for heavy rainfall modeling”.
